# MXJC

XSD to IOS Objective-C and Android Java binding compiler based on JAXB XJC.


##Feature Highlight
1. ***Standard based*** : based on [Oracle JAXB 2.1](http://jaxb.java.net/2.1/) XJC, recognize most standard XML Schema components.
2. ***Objective-c Pico Binding Support*** : auto-generate [Pico for IOS](https://github.com/bulldog2011/pico) bindable classes from XML Schema or WSDL.
3. ***Android Nano Binding Support*** : auto-generate [Nano for Android](https://github.com/bulldog2011/nano) bindable classes from XML Schema or WSDL.
4. ***Doc Auto Generation*** : auto-generate code comments from XML Schema or WSDL annotations.
5. ***JAXB Binding Customization*** : support [JAXB binding customization](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17802_01/webservices/webservices/docs/2.0/tutorial/doc/JAXBUsing4.html) in case the code generated by defaut binding does not meet real needs. 


##How to Use

Download zip package from repository mentioned in version history below, latest stable release is [0.6.1](https://github.com/bulldog2011/bulldog-repo/tree/master/repo/releases/com/leansoft/mxjc/0.6.1), then extract the zip file and run mxjc script in command line:

	
	Usage: mxjc [-options ...] <schema file/URL/dir> ... [-b <bindinfo>] ...
	If dir is specified, all schema files in it will be compiled.
	Options:
	  -nano              :  target Nano for Android as code generation target (default)
	  -privateField      :  generate private fields, accessed by public accessors, only for nano binding
	  -pico              :  target Pico for IOS as code generation target
	  -prefix <prefix>   :  add prefix to the target classes, only for pico binding
	                        (recommended to avoid possible name conflict)
	  -nv                :  do not perform strict validation of the input schema(s)
	  -b <file/dir>      :  specify external bindings files (each <file> must have its own -b)
	                        If a directory is given, **/*.xjb is searched
	  -d <dir>           :  generated files will go into this directory
	  -p <pkg>           :  specifies the target package
	  -httpproxy <proxy> :  set HTTP/HTTPS proxy. Format is [user[:password]@]proxyHost:proxyPort
	  -httpproxyfile <f> :  Works like -httpproxy but takes the argument in a file to protect password
	  -readOnly          :  generated files will be in read-only mode
	  -xmlschema         :  treat input as W3C XML Schema (default)
	  -wsdl              :  treat input as WSDL and compile schemas inside it (experimental,unsupported)
	  -verbose           :  be extra verbose
	  -quiet             :  suppress compiler output
	  -help              :  display this help message
	  -version           :  display version information
